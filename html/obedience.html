         <p class="justify">Dog Training 101</p>
         <p> 
            Here's a crashcourse rundown on dog training. First, a dogs brain funtions differently than ours. This can be used
            to our benefit. When a dog hears higher pitched sounds, it released dopamine in their brain. This is why a dog gets super
            excited when people talk to them in a 'baby voice'. This means, that when we praise them in a high pitched voice, dopamine is
            released and they are literally becoming addicted to the action we are praising them for. On the flip side, if we use a 
            deep voice, it has the opposite effect. I've heard trainers refer to it as the "Christian Bale Batman Voice". When you use this 
            lower voice, it tells your dog the behavior they are exhibiting is unnaceptable. (*IMPORTANT: Always strive for a 90/10 praise-
            correct ratio. We don't want our dogs to be afraid of us, just understand our vocal cues*) Lastly, is a monotone voice. We want to avoid 
            a monotone voice when we are giving a command. A monotone voice neither excites or corrects them. Instead, it sounds like boring, 
            everyday talking. They won't completely tune you out, but helping them to understand what you want of them becomes 1000 times 
            harder.
         </p>
         <p>
            Second, repitition of a command is extrememly important when praising. If I ask my dog to sit, and they sit, I'll praise them by 
            saying "good sit sit sit!!" Repeating the name of the command when I am praising helps them to recognize which part we approved of
            and that we want them to repeat that. It reinforces the names of the commands.
        <p>
            Third, we always want to reward immedietly after the command is complete. If that's a sit, then a soon as they touch the ground, we'll
            vocally praise and give a treat (or toy or attention. Whatever works best for your dog). If you want them to hold the sit, you can verbally
            praise them and then proceed to reward with a treat afterwards. Either way, instant verbal communication that they did what was asked
            of them will encourage them to repeat the action. Then, you practice again! They will pick up on simple behavioral tasks very quickly.
            These can be utilized to stregethen and prolong their abilities.
