        <h4>Hi there! My name is Hailey, and I love dog training. For as long as I can remember, dog training has been something <br>
        I found incredible. Kindergarten me would "write books" on how to properly train a dog to do a trick. Once I hit my <br>
        teens, being able to work with these incredible animals became something more than just a 6 year old me fantasy. I've worked <br>
        with a Utah dog training company for years as I trained my own dogs and others in behavioral, obedience, and agility. Though I <br>
        took some time off to serve a mission for my church, I'm working to get back into it. Here are some of my best tips for starting <br>
        out getting your dog to top tier obedience!</h4>
